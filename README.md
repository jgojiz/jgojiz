# Hi there, I'm Jhorman :metal:

Self taught programmer. I'm interested in frontend, UX and other design approaches and programming paradigms to solve problems.

### This is the path I'm following:

* [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)
* [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome) along with first 2 courses in [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python#courses)
* [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/home/welcome)
* Learning to work with files, pandas and other data science libraries in Python to switch from MS VBA.
* Learning Object Oriented Programming.
* Remaining 3 courses in [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python#courses)
* [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)

### Recommended books:
* **Computer Science - An Overview (12ed)** by J. Glenn Brookshear, Dennis Brylow. Read this as you go through your intro course to Computer Science. This has the most basic concepts you need to understand your craft.
* **Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Start reading the first 4 chapters after your first intro course and as you gain expierience programming.
* [Think Python - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (2ed)](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey. Very well structured, cool examples with exercises and solutions available online.
* **Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code (2ed)** by Martin Fowler - This book and Clean Code will be your best friends to improve on your journey as a developer. With that and an understanding of different programming languages and paradigms, you'll become more conscious of how you design your programs.
* I also recommend to read about standard practices and tools as you go through your own study path.
